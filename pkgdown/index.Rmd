[{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/) is a high-level API client for accessing public market data endpoints on major cryptocurrency exchanges. It supports open, high, low, close and volume (OHLC-V) data and a variety of sentiment indicators; the market data is high quality and can be retrieved in intervals ranging from *seconds* to *months*. 

All the market data is accessed and processed without relying on crawlers, or API keys, ensuring an open, and reliable, access for researchers, traders and students alike.

## Basic usage

Below is an example on retrieving OHLC-V data for Bitcoin in 30 minute intervals,

```{r OHLC, echo=TRUE, fig.alt="cryptocurrency prices in R"}
## get OHLC-V in 30 minute intervals
## for Bitcoin from Binance
## futures market since yesterday
BTC <- cryptoQuotes::get_quote(
  ticker   = 'BTCUSDT',
  source   = 'binance',
  futures  = TRUE,
  interval = '30m',
  from     = Sys.Date() - 1 
)

## display latest
## values
tail(BTC)
```
