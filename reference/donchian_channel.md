# Add Donchian Channels to the chart

**\[experimental\]**

A high-level
[`plotly::add_lines()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/add_trace.html)-wrapper
function that interacts with the
[`TTR::DonchianChannel()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/TTR/man/DonchianChannel.html)-function.
The function adds Donchian Channels to the main
[`chart()`](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/reference/chart.md).

## Usage

``` r
donchian_channel(
 n = 10,
 include.lag = FALSE,
 color = '#4682b4',
 ...
)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  Number of periods for moving average.

- include.lag:

  Should values be lagged so that today's prices are not included in the
  calculation? See Note.

- color:

  A [character](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html)-vector of
  [length](https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html) 1. "#4682b4" by default.

- ...:

  For internal use. Please ignore.

## Value

An [invisible](https://rdrr.io/r/base/invisible.html)
[`plotly::plot_ly()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/plot_ly.html)-object.
