# cryptoQuotes: Open Access to Cryptocurrency Market Data, Sentiment Indicators and Interactive Charts

This high-level API client provides open access to cryptocurrency market
data, sentiment indicators, and interactive charting tools. The data is
sourced from major cryptocurrency exchanges via 'curl' and returned in
'xts'-format. The data comes in open, high, low, and close (OHLC) format
with flexible granularity, ranging from seconds to months. This
flexibility makes it ideal for developing and backtesting trading
strategies or conducting detailed market analysis.
