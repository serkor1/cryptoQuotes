<p>Trading indicators comes in various forms; from the alignment of the
moon relative to the sun, to sophisticated trading rules based on neural
networks which incorporates classified features; It is not possible to
cover them all in an <code>R</code> package.</p>
<p>In this <code>vignette</code> an introduction to the construction of
charts and chart indicators are given, and is recommended for those who
would want to chart indicators not otherwise found in <a href="https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/">{cryptoQuotes}</a>. The
<code>vignette</code> uses the built-in <code>BTC</code>-object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Feel free to make a <code>PR</code> with your
indicators that you wish to share with the rest of the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the charts in <a href="https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/">{cryptoQuotes}</a> uses
<a href="https://github.com/plotly" class="external-link">{plotly}</a> as backend, the
<code>chart</code>-objects complies with it’s syntax.</p>
<div class="section level2">

<p>We start by creating a simple <code>chart</code>-object with
<code>volume</code> as it’s only indicator,</p>

<p>Creating custom indicators for the <code><a href="../reference/chart.html">chart()</a></code>-functions
follows standard <a href="https://github.com/plotly" class="external-link">{plotly}</a>
syntax. Two examples of how these are charted in <a href="https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/">{cryptoQuotes}</a> have
been covered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A full pipeline of charting indicators, custom
and built-in, will be released sometime in the future.</p>
