Trading indicators comes in various forms; from the alignment of the moon relative to the sun, to sophisticated trading rules based on neural networks which incorporates classified features - It is not possible to cover them all in an `R` package.

In this `vignette` an introduction to the construction of charting indicators are given, and is recommended for those who would want to chart indicators not otherwise found in [{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/).

> **Note:** Feel free to make a `PR` with your indicators that you wish to share with the

## Charting indicators

Below is a chart, with the indicators `macd()` and `bollinger_bands()`. Each indicator is created using [{TTR}](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/TTR).

```{r}
chart(
  ticker    = BTC,
  main      = kline(),
  sub       = list(
    macd()
    ),
  indicator = list(
    bollinger_bands()
  ) 
)
```

### The anatomy of indicators

Each indicator is either a *main chart*- or *subchart*-indicator, lets call them `classes` for consistency. The source code for each `class` of indicator is given below,

<details>
<summary>Main chart indicator (Bollinger Bands)</summary>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
bollinger_bands
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Subchart indicator (MACD)</summary>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
macd
```
</details>

Common for both indicator `classes` is that they are wrapped in `structure`, with `class = c("plotly", "htmlwidget")`,

```R
structure(
  .Data = {
  
  # Indicator Logic
  
  },
  class = c(
    yourclass,
    "plotly", 
    "htmlwidget"
  )
)
```

What differentiates the two `classes` of indicators, is the addition of `indicator` or `subchart` in the `yourclass`-placeholder.

The indicator logic is important for the correct charting of your custom indicator. As 
[{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/) uses 
[{plotly}](hhttps://github.com/plotly/plotly.R) as backend for charting, your `class` of indicator has to be consistent with the use of [{plotly}](hhttps://github.com/plotly/plotly.R)-functions. More specifically; `subchart`-indicators uses `plotly::plot_ly()`-functions, while main chart `indicator` uses the `plotly::add_*`-family of functions.

When creating the custom indicators there is a couple of additional steps needed which will be covered in the examples.

## Donchian Channels (Example)

Assume a trading strategy based on Donchian Channels (`TTR::DonchianChannel()`) is needed to optimize your profits. This indicator is a main chart indicator, similar to that of `TTR::BBands()`,

```{r}
tail(
  TTR::DonchianChannel(
    HL = BTC[,c("high", "low")]
  )
)
```

This indicator has three features; `high`, `mid` and `low`. To chart this indicator, we would need to call the `plotly::add_lines()`-function three times to chart it properly. Each of these features are defined as `layers` in [{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/). All layers get built with the `cryptoQuotes:::build()`-function.

```{r}
## define custom TA
## donchian_channel
donchian_channel <- function(
    ## these arguments are the
    ## available arguments in the TTR::DonchianChannel
    ## function
    n = 10,
    include.lag = FALSE,
    ## the ellipsis
    ## is needed to interact with
    ## the chart-function
    ...
) {
  
  structure(
    .Data = {
      
      ## 1) define args
      ## as a list from the ellipsis
      ## which is how the chart-function
      ## communicates with the indicators
      args <- list(
        ...
      )
      
      ## 2) define the data, which in this
      ## case is the indicator. The indicator
      ## function streamlines the data so it works
      ## with plotly
      data <- cryptoQuotes:::indicator(
        ## this is just the ticker
        ## that is passed into the chart-function
        x = args$data,
        
        ## columns are the columns of the ohlc
        ## which the indicator is calculated on
        columns = c("high", "low"),
        
        ## the function itself 
        ## can be a custom function
        ## too.
        .f = TTR::DonchianChannel,
        
        ## all other arguments
        ## passed into .f
        n = n,
        include.lag = FALSE
      )
      
      ## each layer represents
      ## each output from the indicator
      ## in this case we have
      ## high, mid and low.
      ## 
      ## The lists represents a plotly-function
      ## and its associated parameters.
      layers <- list(
        ## high
        list(
          type = "add_lines",
          params = list(
            showlegend = FALSE,
            legendgroup = "DC",
            name = "high",
            inherit = FALSE,
            data = data,
            x    = ~index,
            y    = ~high,
            line = list(
              color = "#d38b68",
              width = 0.9
            )
          )
        ),
        
        ## mid
        list(
          type = "add_lines",
          params = list(
            showlegend = FALSE,
            legendgroup = "DC",
            name = "mid",
            inherit = FALSE,
            data = data,
            x    = ~index,
            y    = ~mid,
            line = list(
              color = "#d38b68",
              dash ='dot',
              width = 0.9
            )
          )
        ),
        
        ## low
        list(
          type = "add_lines",
          params = list(
            showlegend = FALSE,
            legendgroup = "DC",
            name = "low",
            inherit = FALSE,
            data = data,
            x    = ~index,
            y    = ~low,
            line = list(
              color = "#d38b68",
              width = 0.9
            )
          )
        )
      )
      
      ## we can add ribbons
      ## to the main plot to give
      ## it a more structured look.
      plot <- plotly::add_ribbons(
        showlegend = TRUE,
        legendgroup = 'DC',
        p = args$plot,
        inherit = FALSE,
        x = ~index,
        ymin = ~low,
        ymax = ~high,
        data = data,
        fillcolor = cryptoQuotes:::as_rgb(alpha = 0.1, hex_color = "#d38b68"),
        line = list(
          color = "transparent"
        ),
        name = paste0("DC(", paste(c(n), collapse = ", "), ")")
      )
      
      ## the plot has to be build
      ## using the cryptoQuotes::build-function
      invisible(
        cryptoQuotes:::build(
          plot,
          layers = layers
        )
      )
      
    }
  )
  
}
```

The indicator function can be passed into the appropriate argument in the `chart()`-function, which will handle everything else,

```{r}
chart(
  ticker = BTC,
  main   = kline(),
  sub    = list(
    volume()
  ),
  indicator = list(
    bollinger_bands(),
    donchian_channel()
  )
)
```

## Commodity Channel Index (Example)

Assume a trading strategy based on Commodity Channel Indices (`TTR::CCI()`) is needed to optimize your profits. This indicator is subchart indicator similar to that of `TTR::RSI()`,

```{r}
tail(
  TTR::CCI(
    HLC = BTC[,c("high", "low", "close")]
  )
)
```

This indicator has a single feature; `cci`. As this indicator is a subchart indicator with a single feature, we only need a single `layer` built with `plot_ly()`,


```{r}
## define custom TA
## Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
cc_index <- function(
    ## these arguments are the
    ## available arguments in the TTR::CCI
    ## function
    n = 20,
    maType,
    c = 0.015,
    ## the ellipsis
    ## is needed to interact with
    ## the chart-function
    ...
) {
  
  structure(
    .Data = {
      
      ## 1) define args
      ## as a list from the ellipsis
      ## which is how the chart-function
      ## communicates with the indicators
      args <- list(
        ...
      )
      
      ## 2) define the data, which in this
      ## case is the indicator. The indicator
      ## function streamlines the data so it works
      ## with plotly
      data <- cryptoQuotes:::indicator(
        ## this is just the ticker
        ## that is passed into the chart-function
        x = args$data,
        
        ## columns are the columns of the ohlc
        ## which the indicator is calculated on
        columns = c("high", "low", "close"),
        
        ## the function itself 
        ## can be a custom function
        ## too.
        .f = TTR::CCI,
        
        ## all other arguments
        ## passed into .f
        n = n,
        maType = maType,
        c      = c
      )
      
      
      layer <- list(
        list(
          type = "plot_ly",
          params = list(
            name = paste0("CCI(", n,")"),
            data = data,
            showlegend = TRUE,
            x = ~index,
            y = ~cci,
            type = "scatter",
            mode = "lines",
            line = list(
              color = cryptoQuotes:::as_rgb(alpha = 1, hex_color = "#d38b68"),
              width = 0.9
            )
          )
          
        )
      )
      
      cryptoQuotes:::build(
        plot = args$plot,
        layers = layer,
        annotations = list(
          list(
            text = "Commodity Channel Index",
            x = 0,
            y = 1,
            font = list(
              size = 18
            ),
            xref = 'paper',
            yref = 'paper',
            showarrow = FALSE
          )
        )
      )
      
      
      
    }
  )
  
}
```


```{r}
chart(
  ticker = BTC,
  main   = kline(),
  sub    = list(
    volume(),
    cc_index()
  ),
  indicator = list(
    bollinger_bands(),
    donchian_channel()
  )
)
```

## Summary

Creating custom indicators for the `chart()`-functions can be daunting. Two examples of how these are developed in [{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/) have been covered.

> **Note:** A full pipeline of charting indicators, custom and built-in, will be released sometime in the future.

To summarise the example,

1. Define the `indicator`-function (e.g `TTR::CCI()`)
2. Define the `chart`-function for the indicator (e.g `cc_index()`)
    1. Wrap the `indicator`-function in `cryptoQuotes:::indicator()`
    2. Define the `layers` according to features, and wether its a subchart or main chart indicator
    3. Build the chart using `cryptoQuotes:::build()`
3. Add the `chart`-function for the indicator in the appropriate argument in the `chart()`-function
