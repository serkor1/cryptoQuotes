Trading indicators comes in various forms; from the alignment of the moon relative to the sun, to sophisticated trading rules based on neural networks which incorporates classified features; It is not possible to cover them all in an `R` package.

In this `vignette` an introduction to the construction of charts and chart indicators are given, and is recommended for those who would want to chart indicators not otherwise found in [{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/). The `vignette` uses the built-in `BTC`-object.

> **Note:** Feel free to make a `PR` with your indicators that you wish to share with the
> rest of the community.

As the charts in [{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/) uses [{plotly}](https://github.com/plotly) as backend, the `chart`-objects complies with it's syntax.

## Custom Indicators 

We start by creating a simple `chart`-object with `volume` as it's only indicator,

```{r}
# 1) create a simple chart
# object
chart_object <- chart(
  ticker = BTC,
  main   = kline(),
  sub    = list(
    volume()
  ),
  options = list(
    dark = FALSE
  )
)

# 2) display the chart
chart_object
```

### Sine-oscillator

Assume a trading strategy that follows a `sin()`-curve throughout the period of interest. The starting point is generating the indicator,

```{r}
# 1) generate sin-indicator
sin_indicator <- data.frame(
    index         = zoo::index(BTC),
    sin_indicator = sin(seq(0,8*pi,length.out=nrow(BTC)))
  
)
```

The `sin_indicator` in it's basic form can be charted as follows,

```{r}
# 1) create a plotly-object
# with the sin-indicator
sin_indicator <- plotly::layout(
   margin= list(l = 5, r = 5, b = 5),
  p = plotly::plot_ly(
    data = sin_indicator,
    y    = ~sin_indicator,
    x    = ~index,
    type = "scatter",
    mode = "lines",
    name = "sin"
  ),
  yaxis = list(
    title = NA
  ),
  xaxis = list(
    title = NA
  )
)
# 2) display the 
# indicator
sin_indicator
```

The `sin_indicator` can be added to the `chart_object` using `plotly::subplot` which also handles the theming,

```{r}
# 1) append the sin_indicator
# to the chart object
chart_object <- plotly::subplot(
  # ensures that plots are 
  # vertically aligned
  nrows = 2,
  heights = c(
    0.7,
    0.2
  ),
  chart_object,
  sin_indicator,
  shareX = FALSE,
  titleY = FALSE
)

# 2) display the chart
# object
chart_object
```

### Linear Regression Line

Assume a trading strategy that goes long (short) every time the price is below (above) the linear regression line. This indicator can be defined as follows,

```{r}
# 1) linear regression
# line
lm_indicator <- data.frame(
  y = fitted(
    lm(
      close ~ time,
      data = data.frame(
        time = 1:nrow(BTC),
        close = BTC$close
      )
    )
  ),
  index = zoo::index(BTC)
)
```

The `lm_indicator` in it's basic form can be charted as follows,

```{r}
# 1) display the linear
# regression line on
# an empty chart
plotly::add_lines(
  p    = plotly::plotly_empty(),
  data = lm_indicator,
  y    = ~y,
  x    = ~index,
  inherit = FALSE,
  xaxis = "x1",
  yaxis = "y2",
  name  = "regression"
)
```

The `lm_indicator` can be added to the `chart_object` using `plotly::add_lines` which also handles the theming,

```{r}
# 1) add the regression
# line to the chart_object
plotly::layout(
  margin = list(l = 5, r = 5, b = 5, t = 65),
  plotly::add_lines(
    p       = chart_object,
    data    = lm_indicator,
    y       = ~y,
    x       = ~index,
    inherit = FALSE,
    xaxis   = "x1",
    yaxis   = "y2",
    name    = "regression"
  ),
  yaxis = list(
    title = NA
  ),
  xaxis = list(
    title = NA
  )
)
```

## Summary

Creating custom indicators for the `chart()`-functions follows standard [{plotly}](https://github.com/plotly) syntax. Two examples of how these are charted in [{cryptoQuotes}](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/) have been covered.

> **Note:** A full pipeline of charting indicators, custom and built-in, will be released sometime in the future.
