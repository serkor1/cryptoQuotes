```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse   = TRUE,
  message    = FALSE,
  echo       = TRUE, 
  comment    = "#>",
  out.width  = "100%",

```

If you want to use the simplicity of [{tidyverse}](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse)  or the power of [{data.table}](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table), the [{xts}](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts)-object can be easily converted.

However, its important to maintain data integrity, especially, if the date and time zone is important for you.

## Converting xts and zoo to tibble

Converting to `tibble` requires a few steps to achieve the same data structure as the `xts`,

```{r tibble}
# 1) load pipe
library(magrittr)

# 2) convert to tibble
# using as_tibble
tbl <- tibble::as_tibble(
  x = cbind(
    index = zoo::index(ATOM),
    zoo::coredata(ATOM)
  )
) %>% dplyr::mutate(
  index = lubridate::as_datetime(
    x  = index,
    tz = "Europe/Copenhagen"
  )
)

# 3) tail data
head(tbl, 3)
```

## Converting xts and zoo to data.table

Converting to a `data.table` is straightforward as `as.data.table()` handles everything under the hood,

```{r data.table}
# 1) convert to data.table
# using as.data.table
DT <- data.table::as.data.table(
  ATOM
) 

# 2) head data
head(DT, 3)
```


## Checking data integrity

### Checking date integrity

It is important that the date.time has not been converted to a different timezone in the process, without explicitly coding it as such,

```{r}
# 1) store date.time objects
time_objects <- list(
  tbl = tbl$index,
  DT  = DT$index
)

# 2) check if they are all equal
all(
  vapply(
    X   = time_objects,
    FUN = function(x) {
      
      setequal(
        x = x,
        y = zoo::index(ATOM)
        )
      
    },
    FUN.VALUE = logical(1)
  )
)
```

### Checking OHLCV values

It goes without saying that `R`-functions wouldn't tamper with the order of the data during conversion without a warning in the documentation, but nonetheless for the sake of argument, we will check the OHLCV values,

```{r}
# 1) store price objects
# Open price here
open_price <- list(
  tbl = tbl$open,
  DT  = DT$open
)

# 2) check if they are all equal
all(
  vapply(
    X   = open_price,
    FUN = function(x) {
      
      setequal(
        x = x,
        y = ATOM$open
        )
      
    },
    FUN.VALUE = logical(1)
  )
)

```

## Why even convert?

Even though numerical operations on [{xts}](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts)-objects are lightning fast, it comes with a cost; it doesn't support `factors` or `characters`.

Converting the [{xts}](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts)-object is a simple and trivial process, and simplifies grouped operations in a verbose manner.
