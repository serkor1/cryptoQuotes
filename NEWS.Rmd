# cryptoQuotes 1.3.1

## General

> **NOTE:** With this update the package is no longer considered `experimental`.

* Removed deprecated functions `getQuote()`-, `getFGIndex()`- and `getLSRatio()`-functions.

* Removed decprecated functions `availableExchanges()`-, `availableIntervals()`- and `availableTickers()`-functions.

These functions were planned to be deleted in `1.4.0` - however, we have decided to aim for an `JOSS`- and `rOpenSci`-subscription which requires some degree of stability. Hence the deletion of these function at `1.3.0`.

We expect `1.4.0` to be released *after* `rOpenSci`-submission and acceptance :pray:

## Improvements

### New features

* `smi()`-function, a `subchart`-indicator built on the `TTR::SMI()`-function.
* `donchian_channel()`-function, a `main chart`-indicator built on the `TTR::DonchianChannel()`-function

<details>
<summary>Usage</summary>
```{r}
chart(
  ticker = BTC,
  main   = kline(),
  indicator = list(
    donchian_channel()
  ),
  sub = list(
    smi()
  )
)
```
</details>

### Expanded Support

* `get_openinterest()` is now supported by `kraken`

<details>
<summary>Usage</summary>
```{r}
tail(
  get_openinterest(
    ticker   = "PF_XBTUSD",
    interval = "1h",
    source   = "kraken"
  )
)
```
</details>

### Charting

* The `chart()`-function now has proper `light`-theme available that isn't the default `plotly`-values.
* The charts now displays date ranges as a subtitles.
* The `bollinger_bands()`-function now accepts a `color`-argument. These can be passed as `Hexadecimal`-colors or as is, `"blue"` for example.
* A new main chart function has been introduced. `pline()` which is a univariate price chart based on either open, high, low or close prices.

<details>
<summary>Usage</summary>
```{r}
chart(
  ticker = BTC,
  main   = pline(price = "close"),
  indicator = list(
    bollinger_bands(
    color = "steelblue"
  )
  ),
  sub = list(
    volume()
  ),
  options = list(
    dark = FALSE
  )
)
```
</details>

### Documentation

* The documentation has been extensively reworked. This is includes, but not limited to, sample outputs for all `get_*`-functions.

### Backend Changes

* The `chart()`-functions no longer depend on `rlang`. 

> **Note:** we are generally moving away from `rlang`, `purrr` and `tidyverse` in general. We are, however, 
> keeping the `tidyverse` styleguide.

* Removed dependency on `conflicted`-package.

Prior to version `1.3.0` the `get*`-functions were following the syntax of `quantmod` closely, and this goes for the function naming too. With the adoption of the `tidyverse` style guide, there is no conflicts that
needs to be resolved on `stable`- and `experimental`-functions.

### New developper tools

* `pull()`-function
* `var_ly()`-function
* `build()`-function

## Breaking Changes

* The `get_fgindex()`-function now returns columns in lower case.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where `get_fgindex()` where labelled as `deprecated`
* Fixed a bug in the `limitations`-article where the desired number of observations werent compatible with the `kraken`-exchange.
* Fixed a warning in the `get_lsratio()`-function with `source = "binance"`
* Fixed a bug in the `lsr()`-indicator which broke the `chart()`-function when included.
* Fixed a bug in the `get_quote()`-function where if `to = NULL` and `from != NULL` the returned `quote` would be filtered according to `UTC` and not `Sys.timezone()`
* Fixed a bug in the `chart()`-function where the inferred intervals would be incorrect for leap years, and months different from 30 days.

# cryptoQuotes 1.3.0

## Improvements

### General function improvements

* `get_lsratio` and `getLSratio()` supports `kraken` and `bybit` as `source`

* `available_`-functions are more adaptive to the calling environments

```R
## charting the klines
## with indicators as
## subcharts
available_exchanges(type = 'ohlc')
```

Now returns all available exhanges that supports Open, High, Low and Close market data. The `type`-argument can be changed to, for example, `lsratio` to get
all available exchanges that supports Long to Shorts ratios. Similar changes have been made to remaining `available_`-functions.

### Error-handling

All `get_*`- and `available_*`-functions are now more robust to API and input errors.

### Default Returning

* `quotes` and `fear and greed index` now returns `200` rows instead of `100`

### Charting

* The `charts` now has a `dark` and `light` theme. Its passed into the `options = list(dark = TRUE)` of the `chart()`-function.
* The `charts` are now more color deficiency compliant, and the `deficiency` parameter in `options = list(deficiency = TRUE)` now applies to all `chart`-elements
* The `charts` are now constructed without `%>%` and, should, be more intuitive to navigate in. See example below,

```{r}
## charting the klines
## with indicators as
## subcharts
chart(
  ticker     = BTC,
  main       = kline(),
  sub        = list(
    volume()
  ),
  indicator = list(
    bollinger_bands(),
    sma(),
    alma()
  ),
  options = list(
    dark       = TRUE,
    deficiency = FALSE
  )
)
```

### Exchange Support

The following exchanges have been added to list of `exchanges` available,

* ByBit

### New features

* Funding rates, `get_fundingrate()`

<details>
<summary>Usage</summary>
```{r}
## get funding rate
tail(
  get_fundingrate(
    ticker = "BTCUSDT",
    source = "binance"
  )
)
```
</details>

* Open interest, `get_openinterest()`

<details>
<summary>Usage</summary>
```{r}
## get funding rate
tail(
  get_openinterest(
    ticker = "BTCUSDT",
    source = "binance"
  )
)
```
</details>


## Breaking Changes

### Charting

* All the `charting`-functions have been reworked without backwards compatibility, or `lifecycle::deprecated()`-warnings. The `charting`-functions were, and still is, in an `experimental`-stage.

### API Calls

* All `dates` passed to `get_*`-functions assumed the dates were given in `UTC`, and were retrieved as `UTC`. These have now been changed; all functions now uses `Sys.timezone()` as `default` upon request and retrieval.

## Warning

As the `cryptoQuotes`-package has moved to the `tidyverse` style guide, the `getFoo`-functions are now `deprecated`. These will be permanently deleted, and removed from the `cryptoQuotes`-package, at version 1.4.0!


# cryptoQuotes 1.2.1

### Minor Updates

* Added DOGECOIN data. This data is extracted on the `1m` chart, around Elon Musks Tweet.
* Added a usecase in the Vignette about Dogecoin and Elon Musk to showcase the functionality of the library.

### Bugfixes

* Corrected misspelled ticker in Vignette 
* All returned Quotes are now in `UTC`, again.
* Fixed an error on the `Bitmart` API where weekly candles would throw an error.

# cryptoQuotes 1.2.0

* All `from` and `to` arguments are now more flexible, and supports passing `Sys.Date()` and `Sys.time()` directly into the `get`-functions.

* `getQuote()` now returns up to 100 pips preceding the specified `to` date, when `from = NULL`. It returns 100 pips, or up to `Sys.Date()`, from the specified `from` date.

The `getQuote()`-function can now be used as follows;

```
## Specifying from
## date only;
##
## Returns 10 pips
getQuote(
 ticker   = 'BTCUSDT',
 interval = '1d'
 from     = as.character(Sys.Date() - 10)
 )
```

```
## Specifying to
## date only;
##
## Returns 100 pips
getQuote(
 ticker   = 'BTCUSDT',
 interval = '1d'
 to     = as.character(Sys.Date())
 )
```

## Market Sentiment

Four new functions are added,

* `getFGIndex()` which returns the daily Fear and Greed Index.
* `addFGIndex()` which adds the Fear and Greed Index as a subplot to price charts.
* `getLSRatio()` which returns the long-short ratio with varying granularity. Contributor has been credited.
* `addLSRatio()` which adds the long-short ratio as a subplot to price charts.

## Convinience functions added

Three new convinience functions are added applicable to some situations,

* `removeBound()`
* `splitWindow()`
* `calibrateWindow()`

# cryptoQuotes 1.1.0

## Frontend

`getQuote()` now returns up to 100 pips when `to` and `from` is `NULL`

## Backend

* All code has been rewritten so its compatible with `httr2`, the package used `httr` at version `1.0.0`.

## Future releases

In the next release, three more exchanges will be supported. 

## Known bugs

The returned `quotes` are in local timezone, this is an unintentional feature and will be fixed in a bugfix.


# cryptoQuotes 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN submission :rocket:
